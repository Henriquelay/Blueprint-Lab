# Clearing tiles fix

This is the beloved age-old mod 
[The Blueprint Designer Lab](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BlueprintLab_design). This is a fork from [Blu3worf's fork](https://github.com/Blu3wolf/Blueprint-Lab), where clicking the `Clear` button the tiles will be deleted aswell, leaving with the original simulation background again.

## Factorio Mod The Blueprint lab
[Factorio mod](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/BlueprintLab_design)
Adds a way to enter a blueprints lab so you have a testbech for your blueprints.

This is a quickfix to correct a typo in the mod, as it has not been updated in over a year. 

### Licensing
I would generally prefer to license GPLv3, however as this is a very simple typo correction only, this mod remains MIT.
